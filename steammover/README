Convenience script to move steam files between library directories.

What it does:

* Reads all the appmanifest_*.acf files in the "from" directory
* Displays a list of game names to move and asks for input which of those to move
* moves the appmanifest_*.acf files to the "to" directory

It does not (so far):

* Move the actual directories of the game (no trivial way to match gamename/acf with directory)
* Do a lot of error checking
* Show the list alphabetically sorted

Running:
```
steamappmover.py /from/where/you/move/SteamApps /to/where/you/move/SteamApps
```
